Have a robotics idea but don’t know where to start? I’d love to hear about it! All of my consultation sessions are conducted online with a minimum commitment of one hour. I can help at any stage of the development process—from napkin calculations to final URDF renders and validation simulations in either Gazebo or Isaac.

# Areas of experience
I have the most hands on experience with underwater robotics which means I can offer the most help with ROVs and AUVs. I have also conducted consultation sessions with clients working in physical therapy. 

# Rates
Rates vary depending on project complexity. Please email me with a rough idea of what you'd like consultation on, and I’ll provide an estimate.

If you're interested, feel free to [email](mailto:nevinkopp@gmail.com) me to schedule a session. Thank you!
