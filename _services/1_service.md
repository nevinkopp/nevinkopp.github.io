I offer private tutoring services for university students and anyone who is curious about learning about robotics. All of my tutoring sessions are online, please refer to the availability chart to schedule a session. 

# Session format
All of my sessions are conducted online, with a minimum commitment of one hour. Each session begins with a block of time dedicated to identifying the problem. If I am unable to help you, the session will be concluded and your payment will be fully refunded. If I can provide useful assistance, payment for the hour is required in advance.
