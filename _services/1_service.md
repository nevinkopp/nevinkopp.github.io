I offer private tutoring sessions for both university students and anyone who is curious about robotics. I have a couple years of experience tutoring students at Norco community college and was also an engineering TA at the University of California, Riverside during my time as a graduate student. I am a UCR alumni and have a M.S. in robotics so most of the topics I cover will be related to robotics (see following list).

# Session format
All of my sessions are conducted online, with a minimum commitment of one hour. Each session begins with a block of time dedicated to identifying the problem. If I am unable to help you, the session will be concluded and your payment will be fully refunded. If I can provide useful assistance, payment for the hour is required in advance.

If you are interested, please [email](mailto:nkopp002@ucr.edu) me to schedule a session. Thank you!
