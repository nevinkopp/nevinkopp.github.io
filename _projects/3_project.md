The Bread Recipe Autonomous Device (BRAD), is my undergraduate senior design project aimed at simplifying the bread making process by automating the dispensing, mixing, kneading, and baking stages. Our teamâ€™s motivation behind this project was to provide a more convenient and accessible way for consumers to make and enjoy fresh, healthy bread at home.

BRAD is composed of various subsystems, such as the solid dispensing subsystem, the liquid dispensing subsystem, the bread machine interface, lid opening and closing mechanism, and the logic circuitry. The key features of BRAD include a remote connection to the device through a virtual private network that can be accessible through the internet, a bread pan with a durable non-stick coating for easy cleaning, and the ability to add new recipes and ingredients using simple, 3D printed containers. The actual bread machine itself is a standard off the shelf bread maker, this project simply automates the process of using it.

The base of the ingredient container feeds into the auger housing where a Nema 17 stepper motor spins the auger bit which pushes out the ingredient and pours it into the bread maker.

Following the flow of the FSMs, BRAD waits for human input before starting the process. For our project, human input comes in the form of a web app as shown below. The user has the option to make either light or dark white bread in both small or large batches. In future revisions, more bread recipies can be easily added as BRAD is designed to be highly modular. Once a button is pressed, the process is started and can be cacelled at any time through the web app.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
