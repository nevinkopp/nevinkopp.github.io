This was my graduate analytical project. We were tasked with designing and doing a physical analysis of a four joint robotic arm. The configuration and application area was up to us, I decided to do a revolute-prismatic-prismatic-revolte or (RPPR) serial configuration for palletizing in industrial applications. Please refer to the original paper I did while at the university (pdf can be downloaded at the top of the page).
