This was my graduate analytical project. We were tasked with designing and conducting a physical analysis of a four-joint robotic arm. The configuration and application area were up to us. I decided to do a revolute-prismatic-prismatic-revolute (RPPR) serial configuration for palletizing in industrial applications. Please refer to the original paper I did while at the university (the PDF can be downloaded at the top of the page).
