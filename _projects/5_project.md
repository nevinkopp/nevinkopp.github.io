This was one of my final robotics projects during a graduate level course. Our task was to navigate an area with several obstacles and kick a ball into the end goal. In order to achieve this goal, we had to implement several autonomous navigation and control techniques. The robot utilized the A* search algorithm for optimal path planning, enabling efficient obstacle avoidance. For trajectory execution, a PID control system was employed, ensuring accurate and stable motion. Polynomial time scaling was integrated to enhance smoothness and adaptability in trajectory generation. Our team was able to demonstrate successful autonomous navigation by completing the course and kicking the ball into the required goal.
