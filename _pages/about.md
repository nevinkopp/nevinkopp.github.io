Hello! 

I'm Nevin Kopp, a recent graduate of the University of California, Riverside. I worked mainly with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) both with graduate research projects and a full scale AUV deployment. Working with AUVs gave me the chance to gain machine vision, sensor integration, and autonomous navigation systems experience. 

I am currently seeking professional opportunities while expanding my skills through innovative side projects, such as a web-controlled fireworks display, combining IoT and UI design, and a robotic gripper hand for object retrieval.

Outside of my technical work, I enjoy playing the guitar as a creative outlet. My passion for technology, commitment to learning, and hands-on experience make me a versatile and driven individual ready to excel in robotics, automation, and beyond. Thanks for reading!
