Hello! My name is Nevin Kopp and I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Riverside. I worked extensively with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) both with research projects and full scale deployments. My expertise spans areas such as machine vision, sensor integration, and autonomous navigation systems, which are critical to advancing AUV capabilities. Through hands-on projects and research, I have developed a deep understanding of the challenges and innovations in this field, aiming to contribute to the future of underwater exploration and robotics.

I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting, while also engaging in innovative side projects that further expand my technical expertise. These projects include developing a web-controlled fireworks display, which combines IoT technologies and user interface design, and designing a robotic gripper hand aimed at assisting with object retrieval tasks, showcasing my ability to integrate mechanical and software solutions for practical applications.

Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy playing the guitar, which acts as a creative outlet. My passion for technology, dedication to continuous learning, and hands-on project experience make me a driven and versatile individual ready to tackle complex challenges in robotics, automation, and beyond. Thanks for reading!
